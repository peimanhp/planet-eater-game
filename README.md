Planet Eater is a captivating desktop game built with vanilla JavaScript and Canvas. Immerse yourself in a vibrant universe where colorful planets gracefully glide across the screen at varying speeds. Your objective is to strategically maneuver your mouse pointer close to the red planets, utilizing the force of gravity to consume them while avoiding contact with other planets.

To emerge victorious, you must devour all ten red planets within the shortest possible time. Challenge your friends and fellow players to beat your record time in this thrilling competition. 

Upon successfully clearing the game, prepare to witness a visually stunning spectacle as the remaining planets descend like falling balls, obeying the laws of realistic gravity.
